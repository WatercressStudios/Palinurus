    "My eyes stirred open. First slowly, and then bolting open all at once."
    
    "I grasped for air."
    
    "I was awake."
    
    "I was finally awake."
    
    "I was awake, my senses flooding to the brim with suddenly-revived biochemical emotion, but I couldn't move my body."
    
    "I felt so cold. Every single fiber of my being, the blood in my veins, my sore bones, my swelling, pounding head, ached."
    
    "I felt the sting of restraints and harnesses strapping me to my seat, still horridly right after only God knows how many years."
    
    "The whirring of biomedical equipment and the gruesome piercing of several needles along the back of my head and spine reminded me, somberly, of the cryostasis I'd just awakened from."

    "My voice croaked out dry and weak."
    
    "My senses were saturated with vivid, vibrant images; bright colors burned themselves into my sight, every sound I heard felt so loud and so drowned-out at the same time."

    b "I know it hurts. I'm sorry. The pain should wear off in due time. The fluorocarbon-insulation chemicals are working their way out through your bloodstream right now."

    b "Don't worry. I had lots of things to do to fill the time. I read more books, watched more movies, listened to more music..."

    "Something felt very wrong."
    
    "And Budapest... she looked... sick?"
    
    "It was obvious she was faking that glow, that smile of hers. She was feigning happiness with every fiber of her psyche."
