    p "Ah... that time again, huh..."

    "If nothing else, Budapest was punctual. I made to undo my pretzel body from a heap of limbs, rising slowly to the day. My hair was a mess, matted down in awkward places. I rustled it back in somewhat presentable shape."

    "I'd rather have woken up to the morning sun than the sight of stars. It didn't feel natural to live and sleep like this, but... small sacrifice to make in space travel."

    "I'd always been wary about replicators. They sounded great on paper, being able to make any kind of food you needed at any time, but in execution, they left something to be desired."

    "I glanced around the control panel in front of me. Stored just beneath the enormous control deck, a smaller console attached to what looked like an ancient microwave oven kept to itself."

    "Weird place to keep a replicator. I would suppose it was the human pilot's responsibility to provide for their own meals on a flight."

    "I punched in some numbers... what was it? 2424?"

    "The machine hummed and then filled with a bright white light. I opened the door, and once the steam faded away, I saw a small paper cup standing in the center of the contraption."

    "I took a look at the cup's contents."

    "Looked like coffee. I took a sip... and then gagged."

    show console loresmilelook

    b "Hey, did you know they had book clubs for this sort of thing? I wonder if they'd let me host one when we get back!"

    "Admittedly, that was a cute little thought to picture, seeing her hunched over a book, sitting in a circle with a bunch of other Navigators."

    p "What, with the rest of the Personal Navigators? If they still had their limitation chips, then good luck."

    p "I mean, stories like that, they affect people differently. I guess that'd be part of the fun of getting people to sit down and talk about it."

    p "Guess it's all online now. Still, it's a fun thought, thinking of a bunch of strangers, scattered across planets, discussing the same one story."
