    "Mirabelle Station spiraled, ceaselessly, in an otherwise unremarkable corner of deep space."
    
    "I was waiting for my flight number to be called. I tapped a finger against my knee, eager to be on my way."
    
    "I'd rehearsed this ritual countless times before."
    
    "Mirabelle Station was hardly remarkable, as far as space stations went. Though then again, who was to say there were many truly remarkable space stations in the first place?"
    
    "Surely there were hundreds of millions of travelers, passing in droves through Andromeda Central Station."
    
    "Andromeda was a work of art, and performers, painters, composers would all gather in the artificially terraformed central plaza to find an audience."
    
    "It was a mosaic of colors, sights, sounds... a brazen horde of inter-galactic human culture. Like a Venice atop a sea of stars."
    
    "... And I was stuck here, at this gray, factory-produced pit stop, waiting by my lonesome for my flight's preparations to finish up."
    
    "For as long as I could remember, space travel out in the boonies was like this; lonely, tedious, cramped, time-consuming... stripped down to the status of a commute that never seemed to end."
    
    "Space travel as an enterprise was far too expensive, and far too dangerous, for allowing anything short of a mega-corporation to handle the logistics."
    
    "I glanced down to my ticket. Sure enough, there it was. 'Titan Transportation Solutions,' in loud, bold, bleak font. They were one of the big players in the field, and they were the ones that footed the bill for, I don't know, thousands of space stations just like this one."
    
    "And let's be perfectly clear here: space is big. Enormous. Try to wrap your head around how infinitely spread out, how empty it all really is. You can't."
    
    "To get anywhere of consequence in space, one must leapfrog through dozens upon dozens of space stations like these, scattered throughout the galaxy."
    
    "I'd been doing precisely that for the better part of an Old Earth month."
    
    "So rest assured, I was well rehearsed, I knew my lines. I could nail down the song-and-dance in my sleep."
    
    "I was, at any rate, getting restless. There isn't a lot to see in space. Just tons of tiny, identical white dots, and plenty of tiny, gray checkpoints to pass through. But that was the price you had to pay to get anywhere."
    
    "And sometimes, if you were lucky, you'd get the occasional nebula, or debris cloud, or band of pirates..."

    "I focused my attention on the silver spaceship which laid before me. I'd seen many like it before; it was small, intended for a single occupant."
    
    "From the outside, it looked relatively unremarkable. It was sleek, like an arrow."
    
    "The cockpit stood out. The windshield wrapped itself around the front of the vessel, stopping just as the ship's nose began to flow downwards into its underbelly."

    "I remember that, back in the day, every spaceship required human pilots and co-pilots. I guess this was a relic from the old regime."
    
    "There wasn't much room to move around in the cockpit. A hoard of buttons, dials, flashing lights, and other mechanisms were scattered around the control console."
    
    "The cockpit was dominated by the enormous windshield that opened up to a commanding view of, at the moment, precisely nothing."
    
    "Nothing but space and an ocean of stars."
    
    "It was hard to get excited from such a sight any more."
    
    "Within moments, the cockpit was bathed in warm blue light, and a computerized voice began to speak."

    "Delicate, feminine features emerged as one - ears, a nose, the eyes, and a mouth curled in a polite, neutral grin. Two long and slender arms trailed to two small and slender hands, clasping each other in front of the flowing dress."
