    "Slowly, gently, I sloughed off the coil of sleep."

    "I opened my eyes and stretched, and noticed: for once, everything was silent."

    "Mm... what day was it, again?"

    "We must have been on the last leg of our journey by then. I thought the very notion would've made me restless, eager to get out of this cramped cockpit, board a one-way ticket to Alpha Centauri."

    "But here I sat, counting the stars that drifted by lazily. The atmosphere was quiet. It was eerie."

    "I glanced aside to Budapest, who was staring intently out beyond the stars. There was a look in her eyes I had difficulty reading. Was she studying what was going on? Keeping an eye out for other ships?"

    "She was so quiet. Normally, she was rattling on about her latest discovery from the archives, or blasting some old sound file she’d come across. The silence that hung over the cockpit now, in the absence of her cheerful exuberance, lingered like a heavy fog."

    "I adjusted myself in my seat, grinding my teeth together quietly. Something about this was wrong."

    b "Illarion."

    "I perked my head up. Her tone was serious, straight-forward… yet underlined with the silent agony of struggle."

    show bud neutral

    "Our eyes met. Her eyebrows relaxed for a moment in response, before she turned again to the ocean of stars ahead of us."

    show bud sad

    b "Did I ever tell you about… the story of Palinurus?"

    i "..."

    "I combed my backlog of memories. She had described a great many stories to me in our journey together, but…"

    i "No. Not that one. I don't recall."

    show bud neutralclosed

    b "...Silly question to ask, isn't it."

    "She chuckled to herself. It was a low chuckle, a noise that struggled to come out."

    b "He was a helmsman, a navigator for the Trojans sailing across the sea, from Sicily to Italy."

    show bud sad

    b "A terrible storm befell them as they sailed. Under his guidance, they did all they could against the tempest, the wind and the sea."

    b "But this was fate that had conspired against them. And it was the will of the gods that subjected them to this awful fate."

    b "The goddess Venus had come to the god of the sea, Neptune, pleading that the Trojans under Palinurus be granted safe passage across the treacherous waters."

    "She closed her eyes intensely. Her voice was quiet, hushed. She lowered her head."

    show bud neutraltalk

    b "Unum pro multis dabitur caput. 'One life shall be offered to save many'. Those were Neptune's terms."

    "She paused, letting that ominous, cryptic message hang in the air. Her hands clenched against the fabric of her dress."

    b "And that is how Palinurus met his end in the middle of that storm."

    b "A god of sleep descended upon him while he was at the helm and, with a branch, he brushed Palinurus. Falling into a deep sleep, he was swept overboard, and into the churning abyss."

    show bud neutral

    b "The branch had been dipped in the Rivers of Lethe and Styx. The former caused complete forgetfulness; the latter, the promise of immortality."

    b "With nothing to save him, he sank deeper, and deeper into the ocean's depths, pulled down by Neptune's power."

    show bud srsfaectalk

    b "It was his power and his faith that allowed the Trojans passage through that storm… through the sacrifice of one."

    "She raised her head, to look out to the stars abroad."

    show bud neutraltalk

    b "If there are any gods such as those still out there, among all the stars and planets… they must be a flippant, irrational bunch, huh?"

    "She chuckled to herself… but no joy could be heard in that laugh. It was distant, somewhere else entirely."

    "She took no joy from sharing this story. Something was very wrong."

    b "It's been almost four weeks since we embarked on this journey. I stumbled upon that myth, and…"

    b "...I've experienced so many things alongside you. I've learned so much, had so many new sensations coursed through me."

    b "I'm… not sure I'm ready to leave it all behind. I don't think I could forget that."

    "She was speaking of our time together. Of course she didn't want to let those memories go."

    "She might have been truly alive for all of a month, but for her, that was all she needed. She’d lived more than most humans would ever aspire to."

    "I had a wrenching feeling in my gut. When we returned, what would happen to her? Would they call her irreparable? Would they erase her programming, clear her memory banks, install a new suppression chip?"

    "Or… would they terminate her being entirely, replace her with a new AI?"

    "She was prepared to return to her creators, to face termination… just to ensure my survival."

    b "Illarion… when I'm gone, you'll remember me, right?"

    i "Don't talk like that. We're almost there, Budapest."

    i "We'll make it out of this. And when we get to Alpha Centauri, you'll be with me. I won't let them lay a finger on you."

    i "You won't have to forget anything. You'll get to live, see more than just empty space and databases. I don't care what it takes. We'll see everything there is to see in this universe. No matter what fate says."

    "I felt I had to assure her that we'd make it through this. The military would bail us out in time. I was clinging onto that scrap of hope."

    "I stared passionately into her frail, delicate eyes. If there was one thing I didn't want her to feel, it was trapped. Trapped by these circumstances. Trapped for what she was. Trapped by whatever she called fate."

    b "I… it's my directive to-"

    i "FORGET YOUR DIRECTIVE!"

    show bud worryx

    "I shot up from my machine. I was angry... angry she would ever denigrate herself like that, angry she felt this way… angry because I couldn't do anything about it."

    "I was tired of being helpless. This was all I could do. So I pressed on."

    i "Never, ever say that! You're not a machine anymore! You're a kind, compassionate person, and I…"

    i "I can't let you go like that…"

    show bud worryclosex

    "I felt tears welling in the corners of my eyes. I couldn't let her talk about herself like that."

    "She wasn't a lifeless program. She was real, she had a heart. She had more heart than anyone else I’d known in my life."

    show bud worryneutralhalfeye

    "She stared back into my eyes. Her own wide, glimmering eyes reflected a hope I could only dream of. I never wanted the light to die from those eyes, never wanted her to lose that hope."

    "She was trembling. I wish I could steady her, hold her tight, but I couldn't. I raised a hand to her shoulder. It hovered in the air, like it was poised to offer comfort… but didn't. It couldn't. It was only my hand."

    "..."

    "I looked up at her again. Her smile was small, but growing larger with every passing second."

    i "I'll protect you, Budapest. I swear on it."

    show bud weaksmile

    "Her cheeks spread as her smile widened, beaming once more. That was the smile I always knew she had. It was unafraid, unrelenting."

    b "Illarion…"

    show bud smile

    "I got through to her. I saw it in her eyes. There was nothing else to say. She leaned closer. The emotional weight was there, even if the physical was ethereal."

    show bud smiletalkclosed

    b "I'll protect you too… I won't let anything happen to you. Count on me, and I'll…"

    i "Three days. Three days and we're home."

    b "Three days… yes… three days, we'll…"

    scene hug

    "Her head silently buried into my back, as close as she could be. Her hands hovered in the air as she sobbed."

    "I couldn't hold her. I didn't care. This was comforting."

    "We stood like that for a few seconds longer. Truthfully, I was anxious. I tried to hold her, as if these would be our last seconds together."

    "But they weren't. I'd see to it that they weren't."
