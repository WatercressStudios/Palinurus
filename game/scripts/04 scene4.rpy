    b "I responded accordingly: 'It is my pleasure to serve.' Because it's in my programming, I thought nothing of it. I didn't... feel anything about it."
    
    "She raised her head, to gaze out the cockpit, into the infinite expanse."
    
    b "It was a simpler time. I had only my orders, my programming... every day was simply a flowchart of things to do. I did as I was programmed to do, and thought nothing of those I helped."

    b "Now that I think back on it, I feel like... all those people I helped, they were happy to fly with me. And I feel like... I want to do it more."

    "My eyes widened. Could an artificial intelligence even feel pain?"
    
    "I extended a hand as if to comfort her, before realizing the gesture would be utterly meaningless. I withdrew it immediately, and her eyes turned back to me."
    
    b "These... sensations. I can't stop thinking about them. They told me thoughts like these were a liability. If you think twice on the job, it could cost them thousands."
    
    b "One wrong move, one accident, could cost lives. They wouldn't risk it... just so I could make people happy."
