    "Our cockpit hurtled through space, spinning erratically from the scrape of the meteoroid."

    "I clutched to my seat for dear life, feeling the g-forces press me into my seat."

    "Our cockpit, once draped in flashing lights and info-graphic displays, was instead shrouded in a suffocating curtain of darkness..."

    "The only light caught in chaotic glimpses of the stars through the windshield."

    "I winced as the seat-straps dug into my chest, the only thing keeping me from a hard collision with the windshield."

    "I felt nauseous; the might of the centrifugal forces crushing the very air from my lungs."

    "I strained to look to my side, where the Navigator had previously been, furiously pecking away at the interfaces to salvage our wreck of a transit shuttle."

    "The logical part of me understood what it was up to, operating inside circuitry and wiring... but I still felt a wave of dread overcome me."

    "What if it didn't work?"

    "What if the Navigator failed?"

    "What if it didn't manage to restore the power, or there was another breach in the hull?"

    "I'd have become trapped in the deepest, emptiest expanse mankind had ever known."

    "I was trapped. Good as dead, and this was my grave, a coffin of glass and sparking circuitry."

    "It would preserve my final moments, the dying expression on my face as I suffocated and froze in the vacuum of space."

    "'In space, no one can hear you scream.'"

    "It was a quote from an old, ancient story they'd tell to the kids."

    "Perhaps it would've been okay for me to scream here. But not a single utterance escaped from my lips."

    "My throat tightened as I came to terms with the looming shadow of death, hovering over me."

    "I closed my eyes, ready to accept my fate..."

    "My eyes shot open as the cockpit rumbled back to life. The cloak of darkness was cut to ribbons by the various displays stuttering back to life."

    "A flashing red light, planted to the control board, indicated that something was amiss."

    "Donâ€™t worry, flashing light, I noticed."

    "The operating system booted up before my eyes, green code buzzing across a hovering black screen faster than my human eyes could hope to process."

    p "Ack!"

    "There was something... different about the program."

    "Why was it yelling at me now?"

    "Even when we were in the midst of the debris storm, it was calm, orderly, procedural. Sure it was firm and tense, but only in a professional manner."

    "Looking at it now, scrambling to make key adjustments, frantic movements, it was most certainly panicking."

    "Normal for a human looking into the face of inevitable death, but an artificial intelligence was different."

    "AIs had to remain calm in all circumstances. They even had Sentience Limitation Codecs, chips inside of them that suppressed sentient and emotional behavior."

    "Maybe this was just some sort of scenario... the Personal Navigators had never been programmed for?"

    "But I guessed that would be in the programming of what was essentially a space stewardess, now that I thought about it."

    "I smirked. In any case, that was one hell of an understatement on her part."

    "Ahhh, different from the machine I spoke with when I boarded, I meant."

    "I thought I might've seen a spark, or something like that, in her eyes."

    "... Wait. 'She?' 'Her?' It was still a machine, for God's sake... Why they designed them like this, I'd never know..."

    "I shook my head, forcefully, as if to force out the intrusive thoughts."

    p "Hey, uh..."

    show console worrylook

    "But it was more than that. She looked straight into me. Upfront, honest."

    scene cockpit1

    "I took a look around the cockpit. Now that the situation had calmed down a bit, I recognized now would be a good time to get our bearings together. At the very least we were unharmed."

    "Budapest seemed in top shape and I was a little shaken, but not stirred. Nonetheless, we'd been knocked off-course, and separated from the rest of the ship. Nothing but a control-center left over -- a head without a body."

    show console warningneutral

    b "According to the diagnostics I've in front of me, while the cockpit should have been equipped with an operating thruster subsystem..."

    b "It seems a stray meteoroid smashing into our hull caused critical damage to that particular component."

    p "So, what you're saying is... we're stuck in a lifeboat without a paddle right now?"

    b "Thankfully, a sufficient amount of life-support subsystems are in close to optimal working condition. Artificial gravity generation, oxygen pump, sustenance replicator..."

    "So there was a replicator installed in the cockpit; good. I'd started to worry about how I'd be feeding myself in here."

    "Artificially manufactured, cold chemical-paste called 'food' wasn't exactly something out of a dream, but at least I wasn't going to starve."

    b "... Ah, and our solar panels are in working order as well. I'm confident we won't be running out of power for any length of our journey."
