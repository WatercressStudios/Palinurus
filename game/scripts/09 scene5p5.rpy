    "Distracted by my thoughts, I couldn’t hold back a yawn that suddenly emerged from within. Instantly, her semi-translucent eyes darted right back toward me."

    i "Well, there it is...."
    
    b "Just stick it near one of your veins, it'll do the rest."

    "I grabbed the device, rolling my right cuff down. Carefully, I attached it an inch or so down my elbow, and it quickly sealed to my skin. Simple."
