    "I hurried back to my seat in the cabin to look out the window, squinting my eyes to see through the blackness of space."

    "I could make out a few sparkling lights... reflections? Yeah. Reflections."

    "The ship itself had bright, powerful lights attached to its wings, tail and under the cockpit, and every time they flashed I got a peek at some some sort of approaching mass."

    "Meteoroids. Hundreds, maybe thousands of meteoroids, drifting aimlessly through space, clustered together in a school."

    "They encroached closer, unrelenting, a soaring landslide of steel, on a direct collision course with the shuttle."

    "I felt my heart sank deep down my stomach. Actually, no, it went past that."

    "Plummeted straight down to my bowels."

    b "... Oh, that's not good."
   
    "'Tap tap tap tap.'"
   
    "I could hear the sound of particles hitting against the hull, the pressure of metal ringing."
   
    "They started sparse, spread out..."
   
    "'Tap tap tap TAP TAP TAP TAP!'"
   
    "Only a few minutes ago, the cabin had been eerily silent. And now a constant stream of sound filled it, like we'd flown into the midst of a typhoon."
   
    "I could imagine the cold wind hitting my face; the fury of the Old Earth."
 
    "I think it was a better coping mechanism. I'd rather be lost in a storm on a terrestrial surface than weathering a debris storm in a dingy old shuttle in one of the most remote parts of charted space."
   
    "I winced, popping an eye open. A heavier rock pounded against the hull, and the ship lurched to one side."
  
    "It didn't seem like we'd sustained any serious damage yet, so I sat there, clenching my legs, wringing my hands in desperation, hoping the storm would soon pass."

    "'Wham! Wham!'"
   
    "Like fists driven by fury and rage, the meteoroids continued to pound against the shuttle."
   
    "With each impact, the rocks dug into the hull, denting it and pushing against the cabin walls."
   
    "The flooring pressed against my legs as a large divot was suddenly formed. That was too close for comfort."
   
    "Another larger meteoroid ricocheted off the window I was seated next to. I flinched and writhed in my seat."
   
    b "Look, I've been through worse than this before, alright?"

    "They came into sight. I saw enormous meteoroids, the heavy hitters of the storm, hurling themselves directly in our path. Even the awe-inspiring, holy light of the distant stars cowered in the shadow of the meteoroids."
  
    "One was on a due course for the cabin. It was a wretched, gray-jagged mass that glistened devilishly, its iron deposits reflecting the flashing emergency lights of our ship."
  
    "It was going to impact, and it was going to impact very soon."
