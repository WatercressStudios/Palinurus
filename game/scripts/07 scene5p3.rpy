    "That was the first thought that popped into my head as I parted my eyelids to an expanse of stars that might as well have been the same ones I fell asleep counting."

    "Even with centuries of entertainment to fill the void, time began to lose its coherence; minutes blended into hours which melded into days."

    "Such is the fate of man in space, which I suppose is why cryostasis was invented: to quickly pass the long intervals between departure and arrival that could otherwise drive you bonkers."

    "The second thought that occurred to me as I stirred awake in my seat was that, for an AI, Budapest was one hell of a singer."

    "I straightened up in my chair and opened my eyes to see her facing the wind-shield, her back turned towards me; she was singing an old familiar melody, one I must have heard dozens of times as a kid, in movies and cartoons."

    "Her voice gave it a grace that I never knew it could have."

    b "Beautiful dreamer, wake unto me,"

    b "Starlight and dewdrops are waiting for thee;"

    b "Sounds of the rude world, heard in the day,"

    b "Lull’d by the moonlight have all passed away…"

    "Her arms hung by her side as she swayed gently in time with each line, and, for a moment, I forgot she wasn’t human. Why would an AI move so gracefully to the tune of a song?"

    "Why would an AI — even a sentient one — sing, for that matter? Was it some sort of lullaby meant for me?"

    "I don’t know long I was out, but she couldn’t have sung me to sleep. My periods of sleep and wakefulness might have been starting to blend together into one indistinct blur, but there’s no way I could have forgotten a voice so genuine, so sweet."

    b "...awake unto me!"

    b "Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!"

    b "...awake unto me!"

    b "Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!"

    "Then again, maybe the point was to wake me up; she seemed unaware that her song had gained an audience, but perhaps she wasn’t."

    "I had never paused to consider how lonely Budapest must be when I slept."

    "When I’ve been conscious, she has had someone to share her feelings with, someone to relate her excitement to as she digests volume after volume of human history."

    "But for the duration of my slumbers, she’s been left alone with no one to share these new experiences with."

    "Whether she had intended to wake me or not, I decided that I wouldn’t do or say anything that might interrupt her singing."

    "And so, hoping not to draw her attention, I sat perfectly still; doing so was easy as with every new verse I found myself more captivated by her performance, entranced by her flowing red hair and dress as they swayed with her body to the music."

    "Just a hologram gazing out into the depths of space, singing with more emotional sincerity than any human being I'd ever heard."

    "She turned around mid-verse, and so I quickly leaned back in my seat and pretended I was asleep, leaving my eyes open just enough to see the beaming smile on her face. She was practically glowing."

    b "The song you just heard is titled “Beautiful Dreamer” and was written in 1826 by…"

    "I smiled and nodded politely as she babbled excitedly about the history of the song, its composer, and of that era in music history."
