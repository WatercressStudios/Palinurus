    b "It turns out, back when were knocked off-course in the debris storm, a small scrap of metallic debris managed to collide with the cockpit, leaving a microscopic crack."
    
    show bud panicfrown
    
    b "It was at first only millimeters long but, after all this time, it's grown and..."
    
    b "The cockpit windshield's integrity is currently at two percent. It's going to be breached very soon."
    
    b "And when that window is breached, it will shatter, and the cockpit will be exposed to open space."

    b "Well, there was an amount of possible weak-points which my diagnostic systems detected as soon as we cleared the debris storm, but things really worsened while you were asleep."
    
    b "I first noticed that the crack had grown larger about one, maybe two hundred years ago... or maybe, it was even earlier than that..."

    b "But surely, things have been continually worsening. Things have gotten very bad."
    
    b "And I've just been sitting here, like some powerless little girl. There wasn't a single thing I could do about the crack."
    
    b "All I could do was sit and watch the crack grow longer and longer, like it was a brutal, heartless example of my own mortality."

    b "This may be a little hard to believe, but..."

    b "Exactly two hours ago, the shuttle's short-range radar detected a manned vessel within communications range."

    b "Now, it's been more than a half a millennium, so our equipment has become quite severely outdated, but we should still be able to make contact with them."

    b "Analyzing their signals and registration codes, they're definitely human, but... different."

    b "I'm sorry. I'm not quite sure, I can't really process all this information so well anymore."

    b "My firmware's woefully outdated compared to all this fresh data, and, it turns out, more of my processors have failed than I'd originally thought..."

    b "But I still think there's something I can do."

    b "As of now, my battery's running on fumes; the power is barely enough to keep my display lit."

    b "But I should be able to siphon what power is left in it to activate a distress beacon."

    b "I managed to make some repairs to our comms equipment while you were in stasis. It's a crude job, and the energy source won't be very clean..."

    b "But I'm confident the signal is going to reach them."

    b "And if the universal signal of distress hadn't changed from the time of the seas of Old Earth to ours, I doubt it has from ours to theirs."

    "I used a moment to take in everything Budapest was telling me."

    "Her voice was getting quieter and lighter, and there was more static and feedback coming from the speakers, so it was hard to make out, but I think I understood most of it."

    "I sat there, digesting, until the realization hit me."
    
    i "But, Budapest, if you're going to be draining the last of your battery, then..."

    b "Either I drain myself dry so that you may live, or I let the wind-shield shatter, and waste away as we drift from our last chance at salvation."

    b "And if we went with the second choice, that means I'd have to watch you die, slowly, in agony, exposed to space..."

    b "I could never let that happen to you."
